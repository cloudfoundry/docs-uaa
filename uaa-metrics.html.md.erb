## <a id="intro"></a> Introduction

User Account and Authentication (UAA) emits metrics constantly. These metrics can help you understand performance over time, troubleshoot problems, and asses the health of your installation in real-time. These metrics are emitted through Loggregator.

This topic describes different metrics that UAA, virtual machines (VMs), and Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) emit.


## <a id="performance"></a> Understanding UAA Performance

These tables explain different types of UAA and UAA-related metrics you can view. There are three different metric areas discussed in the following tables:

* <a href="#global">Global metrics</a> are metric values UAA emits.
* <a href="#vm-vitals">Virtual machine (VM) vitals</a> are metric values UAA reads from the VM.
* <a href="#jvm-vitals">Java Virtual Machine (JVM) vitals</a> are metric values UAA reads from the JVM.

Each table depicts the following information:

* **Name**: The name of the metric.
* **Type**: How the metric is displayed (for example, counters, gauges, or timers).
* **Description**: An explanation of what values this metric displays.
* **Example**: A code sample of this metric's output.
* **Indicator**: A discussion of what changes in the metric's value may indicate over time.
* **Status**: **Active** metrics may change between metrics emissions, whereas **static** metrics are fixed and do not change.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If consuming UAA metrics through the Firehose, incremental metrics (in other words, metrics that capture an increment or decrement in a value since last emission) are expressed as cumulative values. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/statsd-injector">statsd-injector</a>.</p>

### <a id="global"></a> Global Performance Metrics

This section describes metrics that UAA emits.

<table class="nice">
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Type</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<th>Example</th>
	<th>Indicator</th>
	<th>Status</th>
	<tr>
		<td>requests.global.completed.count</td>
		<td>Counter</td>
		<td>Number of HTTP requests the server has processed since last metric emission. This metric includes all requests sent to the server, including health checks.</td>
		<td><code>uaa.requests.global.completed.count:1|c</code></td>
		<td>You can use this metric to calculate request load and throughput.</td>
		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>requests.global.completed.time</td>
		<td>Gauge.</td>
		<td>Average time in milliseconds spent per HTTP request. This metric is calculated as an average across all completed requests, including health checks.</td>
		<td><code>uaa.requests.global.completed.time:60|g</code></td>
		<td>A rise may indicate problems with server or database.</td>
		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>server.inflight.count</td>
		<td>Gauge.</td>
		<td>Number of requests the server is currently processing (also known as in flight requests).</td>
		<td><code>uaa.server.inflight.count:1|g</code></td>
		<td>If this number climbs continuously, it can indicate that servers are getting saturated and are unable to handle the incoming load.</td>
		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>		
	<tr>
		<td>requests.global.unhealthy.count</td>
		<td>Counter (gauge in 4.9.0).</td>
		<td>Number of completed requests that exceeded the tolerable response time since last metric emission. Each <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/metrics-data/src/main/resources/performance-url-groups.yml">URL group</a> can have a different tolerable completion time, which is preconfigured in each UAA release. These values are currently not configurable.</td>
		<td><code>uaa.requests.global.unhealthy.count:1|c</code></td>
		<td>If the number of requests not meeting tolerable completion time is growing, than either the tolerable request time needs to be fine tuned for false negatives or the server does not have enough capacity to handle the request load. The actual cause for this can be the need for an increase in server or database resources and further metrics are needed to actually make a scaling decision.</td>

	</tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>requests.global.status_4xx.count</td>
		<td>Counter.</td>
		<td>Number of HTTP requests that returned 400 codes (client error) since last metrics emission. These do not indicate server errors. A 400 code may indicate an invalid request to the server.</td>
		<td><code>uaa.requests.global.status_4xx.count:1|c</code></td>

		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>server.idle.time</td>
		<td>Timer.</td>
		<td>The number of milliseconds that the server has spent in an idle state, when no requests were being processed. This allows a client to calculate the amount of actual, rather than cumulative, time the server has spent processing requests with <code>up.time-idle.time</code>.</td>
		<td><code>uaa.server.idle.time:2346751|g</code></td>
		<td>This metric allows the client to calculate when the server is receiving load time.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>database.global.completed.count</td>

		<td>Number of database queries the server has processed since last metrics emission.</td>

		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>database.global.completed.time</td>
		<td>Gauge.</td>
		<td>The average amount of time in milliseconds per database query.</td>

		<td>Active.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>database.global.unhealthy.count</td>
		<td>Counter.</td>
		<td>Number of database queries that failed or didnâ€™t meet tolerated response time since last metrics emission. The response time is not configurable during runtime.
