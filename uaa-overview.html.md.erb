User Account and Authentication (UAA) is an open source identity server [project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) under the Cloud Foundry (CF) Foundation. 

UAA provides enterprise-scale identity management features. For example, it is used by the following commercial services: 

* [Pivotal Single Sign-On Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/services/identity-and-security/sso): Identity Services for Apps and APIs running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* [GE Predix Identity Services](https://docs.predix.io/en-US/content/service/security/user_account_and_authentication/uaa-service-overview)
* [SAP HANA Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.01/en-US/c6f36d5d49844bd790798ea36538e024.html)

## <a id="overview"></a>What is UAA?

UAA provides identity-based security for applications and APIs. It supports open standards for authentication and authorization, including the following: 
<ul>
<li>OAuth</li> 
<li>OpenID Connect</li>
<li>SAML</li>
<li>LDAP</li>
<li>SCIM</li>
</ul>

The major features of UAA include the following:
<ul>
	<li>User Single Sign-On (SSO) using federated identity protocols</li>
	<li>API security with OAuth</li>
	<li>User and group management</li>
	<li>Multi-tenancy support</li>
	<li>Support for <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> and **opaque** as a token format</li>
	<li>Token revocation</li>
	<li>Operational flexibility<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>Operate and run as a <a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release?all=1">BOSH release</a>, which allows multi-cloud deployment capabilities</li>
		<li>Push as an app to Cloud Foundry</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Database flexibility, including support for MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server</li>
	<li>Auditing, logging, and monitoring</li>
	<li>Token exchange for SAML and JWT bearers</li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/index.html">Rest APIs</a> for authentication, authorization, and configuration management</li>
</ul>

## <a id="securing"></a>The Role of UAA in Securing Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry relies on UAA for its identity and access management requirements.
UAA secures user and system access to Cloud Foundry installations.

Since Cloud Foundry is primarily used in the enterprise context, UAA supports enterprise SSO workflows. If a user has already authenticated against the enterprise identity provider, they can access Cloud Foundry without re-entering credentials.

Some of the major components of Cloud Foundry that use UAA include the following: 

* Cloud Controller 
* Gorouter 
* Loggregator
* Container Networking 

Each of these components expose APIs for user and system interaction. UAA uses OAuth to secure the APIs exposed by core Cloud Foundry components.  

UAA secures many different CF components, including the following:

* CF CLI
* Cloud Controller
* Loggregator 
* Notifications 
* Gorouter 
* Container Networking
* Diego
* Operations Manager/BOSH Director
* Autoscaler
